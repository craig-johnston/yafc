## Release Algorithm

This page describes the steps to make a YAFC release. 
The purpose of this page is to be a reminder to the person who releases about the necessary steps.
1. If the YAFC version has not been updated yet, then increase the project version by updating it in the Yafc project-properties in Visual Studio.
2. Build the deliverables with `./build.sh`.
3. Start a Github release draft. Specify the tags and use the button to make release notes. Organize them as necessary.
4. Upload the deliverables and publish the release.
